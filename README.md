# rangeproof

It is the initial version of the protocol of polynomial rangeproof.

It is based on mcl. 

Some tools are implemented:

- uni-veriate NTT and INTT, bi-veriate NTT and INTT
- uni-veriate polynomial product, bi-veriate polynomial product
- uni-veriate polynomial division, bi-veriate polynomial division
- uni-veriate kzg, bi-veriate kzg
- sumset representation
